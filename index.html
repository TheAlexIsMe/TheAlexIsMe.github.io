            { q: "The primary purpose of social media is connection, not commerce.", a: false, feedback: "False. Social media's primary incentive is selling attention, making it commerce, not pure connection." },
            { q: "Authenticity online is a performance, not a reality.", a: true, feedback: "True. You are always curating a version of yourself for an audience." },
            { q: "The image on your phone screen is more real than the reality outside your window.", a: false, feedback: "False (but debatable!). Don't let the digital feed replace the real world." },
            { q: "AI generated art fundamentally devalues human creativity.", a: true, feedback: "True. While a tool, unchecked AI output shifts the value from skill to prompt, arguably devaluing the effort." },
            { q: "You can fully understand a person from their curated profile.", a: false, feedback: "False. The filter always obscures more than it reveals." },
            { q: "College is more about finding yourself than getting a job.", a: true, feedback: "True. The long-term value is often in the perspective gained, not just the degree." },
            { q: "Photography is inherently less truthful than painting.", a: false, feedback: "False. Both can be manipulated; photography merely offers the illusion of objectivity." },
            { q: "Personal privacy is an outdated concept in the digital age.", a: false, feedback: "False. Privacy is a necessary shield against commercial and state overreach, regardless of technology." },
            { q: "The more choices you have, the happier you are.", a: false, feedback: "False. Paradox of Choice often leads to anxiety and regret." },
            { q: "Reading criticism about art is more important than simply experiencing it.", a: true, feedback: "True. Criticism teaches you <b>how</b> to look, enriching the experience." },
            { q: "The constant need for digital validation is changing human behavior for the worse.", a: true, feedback: "True. Seeking approval via likes encourages performative rather than genuine actions." },
            { q: "All news outlets are equally biased, making true objectivity impossible.", a: false, feedback: "False. Degrees of bias vary wildly; dismissing all media as equal is intellectual laziness." },
            { q: "If a photo is beautiful, its ethical origins don't matter.", a: false, feedback: "False. The ethics of image creation (e.g., exploitation) are inseparable from its value." },
            { q: "Humor is the highest form of defense against harsh reality.", a: true, feedback: "True. Comedy offers necessary distance and catharsis from overwhelming issues." },
            { q: "The attention economy makes genuinely deep thought difficult.", a: true, feedback: "True. Our brains are conditioned for short, frequent distractions, undermining focus." },
            { q: "You should avoid displaying vulnerability online.", a: true, feedback: "True. Genuine vulnerability is often exploited for content, not met with support." },
            { q: "Money can buy happiness if spent on experiences, not material things.", a: true, feedback: "True. Investing in experiences generally leads to greater long-term satisfaction." },
            { q: "Every piece of media is propaganda for something.", a: true, feedback: "True. Media inherently advocates a viewpoint, even if subtle." },
            { q: "The use of filters on selfies is harmless fun.", a: false, feedback: "False. They contribute to unrealistic beauty standards and body dysmorphia." },
            { q: "Technology always progresses; it never regresses.", a: false, feedback: "False. Technology can fail, become obsolete, or be weaponized, leading to cultural or societal regression." },
            { q: "It is possible to be truly politically neutral.", a: false, feedback: "False. Inaction or silence on issues is, itself, a political stance." },
            { q: "Art should always be challenging and uncomfortable.", a: true, feedback: "True. Art that only comforts fails to provoke necessary reflection or change." },
            { q: "The majority opinion is usually the correct one.", a: false, feedback: "False. History is filled with examples of correct ideas starting as minority opinions." },
            { q: "Every creative endeavor is essentially a form of self-therapy.", a: true, feedback: "True. The act of creating is often driven by a need to process and externalize inner thoughts." },
            { q: "You need a mentor to achieve true professional success.", a: false, feedback: "False. While helpful, mentorship isn't required; self-direction and grit often matter more." },
            { q: "Nostalgia is fundamentally a negative emotion.", a: false, feedback: "False. Nostalgia can be a positive source of comfort and identity, if not lived in excessively." },
            { q: "The best critiques are always constructive, never destructive.", a: false, feedback: "False. Some destructive critiques are necessary to tear down harmful or incompetent structures." },
            { q: "Free speech means you can say anything without consequence.", a: false, feedback: "False. Free speech protects you from government censorship, not social or employment consequences." },
            { q: "The term 'Digital Nomad' romanticizes economic instability.", a: true, feedback: "True. It often glosses over visa issues, loneliness, and the high cost of perpetual travel." },
            { q: "It is easier to be a creative person now than 50 years ago.", a: true, feedback: "True. Access to distribution (the internet) and tools is unprecedented." },
            { q: "A world without competition would be better.", a: false, feedback: "False. Competition, in a healthy environment, drives innovation and quality." },
            { q: "The idea of 'work-life balance' is a myth designed to make people overwork.", a: true, feedback: "True. It suggests work and life are equal but often demands work takes priority." },
            { q: "Influencers have more real power than traditional politicians.", a: true, feedback: "True. Influencers often command more immediate, targeted engagement and cultural shaping power." },
            { q: "It's wrong to derive joy from others' mistakes.", a: false, feedback: "False. Schadenfreude, or relief at not being the mistake-maker, is a natural human coping mechanism." },
            { q: "All ethical dilemmas can be solved by logic.", a: false, feedback: "False. Ethics often involves conflicting values and emotion, which defy pure logic." },
            { q: "The most important skill today is the ability to adapt, not deep knowledge.", a: true, feedback: "True. Knowledge rapidly changes; adaptability ensures survival in fluctuating fields." },
            { q: "The true cost of fast fashion is worth the cheap price.", a: false, feedback: "False. Environmental and labor costs heavily outweigh the savings." },
            { q: "Everyone should aspire to be a CEO or leader.", a: false, feedback: "False. Not all personality types or career goals align with leadership; contribution is key." },
            { q: "The internet has made us lonelier, not more connected.", a: true, feedback: "True. Superficial digital connections often replace meaningful physical interaction." },
            { q: "If you didn't document it, it didn't really happen.", a: false, feedback: "False. Experiences exist independently of their recording; live in the moment." },
            { q: "True vulnerability requires acknowledging your weaknesses.", a: true, feedback: "True. It is about honesty regarding failure and imperfection, not just sharing sadness." },
            { q: "Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit.", a: false, feedback: "False. Sarcasm is a highly nuanced form of communication, requiring subtle understanding." },
            { q: "Being busy is the same as being productive.", a: false, feedback: "False. Busyness often involves low-value tasks; productivity focuses on impact." },
            { q: "The best education comes from life experience, not institutions.", a: true, feedback: "True. While institutions provide structure, practical life experience provides irreversible wisdom." },
            { q: "Happiness is a choice.", a: false, feedback: "False. While actions influence mood, happiness is also heavily influenced by genetics, environment, and external factors." },
            { q: "Digital tools have destroyed the concept of unique handwriting.", a: true, feedback: "True. Typed communication has standardized expression, reducing unique penmanship." },
            { q: "Failure is always necessary for growth.", a: true, feedback: "True. Learning from mistakes provides insights that success often obscures." },
            { q: "It is possible to escape political polarization.", a: false, feedback: "False. Polarization is baked into modern information delivery; active avoidance is difficult." },
            { q: "All art is subjective.", a: false, feedback: "False. While <b>enjoyment</b> is subjective, the <b>craft</b> and <b>historical impact</b> can be objectively analyzed." },
            { q: "The only person you should compete against is your past self.", a: true, feedback: "True. Focusing on self-improvement provides sustainable motivation over external comparison." }
